# FedEx-SmartHackathon
Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System

A critical challenge in logistics and transportation is optimizing vehicle routes to ensure timely
deliveries while minimizing environmental impact. FedEx seeks to develop an advanced
dynamic routing system that leverages real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle data to
recommend the most efficient routes. Additionally, the system should estimate vehicle
emissions for each route to help reduce the company's carbon footprint.
Design a Python-based application that integrates multiple APIs, such as TomTom for realtime traffic data, Google Maps, AQICN for meteorological data, and OSRM for route
generation. The application should allow users to input vehicle details and destinations,
calculate optimal routes in real-time, and provide detailed emissions data for each route option.
The goal is to enhance travel efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and promote
environmental sustainability.
Objective:
• Develop a Python-based dynamic routing system using real-time data from various
applicable APIs.
• Optimize vehicle routes considering traffic, weather, and vehicle-specific details.
• Estimate and minimize vehicle emissions for each route.
• Ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible.
